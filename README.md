localthresh
===========

Implementation of some fast local adaptive thresholding algorithms in C.

This program makes use of the GraphicsMagick library, available at http://http://www.graphicsmagick.org/

Compilation: From the project directory, type "make".

Usage: (At this point, only a local adaptive method based on the mean is implemented)

./localthresh [-w windowsize] [-c constant] input output

References: More information about local thresholding based on the mean is available at http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/adpthrsh.htm
